                  <h1>Adam Batchellor</h1>
                  <p>I retired from the Air Force in Mar 2025 after 20 years of service, and am looking forward 
                    to starting a new challenge.</p>

                   <p>Throughout my military career, I was always collecting, connecting, and communicating information 
                    across the health care and higher education industries.  During my last six-months on active duty, I completed
                    a fellowship to upskill in programming and data visualization to further expand the audiences my work could reach.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am hoping to continue growing my communication and leadership skills, and to building on my extensive experience in 
                    developing customer-focused solutions.  As a life-long learner, and an aggressively curious person, I am confident that I can grow and thrive in 
                    a new field of work.</p>
